## Overview 

* Being late to the project
* Making code and data more reusable
* Dreams and challenges

## Bit of background!

* _Digital Research_ group at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
* Fairly new team of Research Software Engineers with varied backgrounds
* Me: code and devops, mostly public sector, lots of open source geospatial
* Hoping to increase research support for open source hardware

## WP4 - shrub attributes from drone data

* Deep learning model (Attention Unet) for detecting shrub shapes 
* Methods for attributing heights that then feed into biomass calculations
* Turning research prototypes into workshop material
* Publishing and documenting data! 

## Start with data

## Create shared archives

* Researchers have local, duplicate copies
* Data wants to live where the compute is!
* Everyone has their own complex needs and favourite ecosystem of tools
* Easy to get caught up in abstract, standards-driven designs
* Need to work where people already are

## s3 Cloud storage

* An Amazon Web Services protocol, but with open source implementations (MinIO)
* [guide.cloudnativegeo.org](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org)
* Built-in readers and drivers in many open source libraries
* Lucky to have [JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk/) offering s3 in the UK, via STFC

## Ideals 

* Spatial-Temporal Asset Catalogue - communoity standard, rooted in reuse
* STAC catalogue for metadata and query
* DVC (Data Version Control) to link and track models and data from git
* Like [Microsoft's Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com)
* [Pangeo @ EOSC](https://pangeo-eosc.vm.fedcloud.eu/)

## Challenges

* Our storage is time-limited to the project funded phase
* Zenodo is lovely for archiving, but is it meant for programmatic reuse?
* We want to stay open, but is our infrastructure set up for a barrage of crawlers?

## Reproducible, reusable code

* From research prototype to installable package
* [EVERSE.eu](https://everse.software/) - European Virtual Institute for RSE
![three tiers view of evolving research software](images/everse_three_tiers.png)
* Continuously-running tests; simple packaging, direct install from git

## Challenges 1

* More LLM-generated code
* If it must happen, generate tests, pipelines and packaging too!
* Tried it both ways, took about the same time

## Challenges 2

* Reproducible environments
* "Living off the land" approach to compute infrastructure (Colab)
* Making dependencies easy to install
* Keeping notebooks and packages synchronised
* Design for workshops encourages reusability, too

## Portability

* Move out of personal projects to a shared Organisation
* Futureproof against people moving on
* We set up a [MAMBO Horizon WP4 Github Organisation](https://github.com/MAMBO-Horizon-WP4/) 
* [ICAERUS](https://icaerus.eu/) offer a shared platform for code and models, EU wide

## Adaptability

* Github has powerful network effects, but who can say what its future holds?
* Trialling Codeberg for another, standalone biodiversity monitoring project ([BatSync](https://codeberg.org/BatSync))
* Institutional collaboration as well as reputation
